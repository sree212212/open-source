i am from mathematics and computing department
i am a beginner
i am a begginer with lot of intrest i just need an oppurtunity to explore about everything and to explore myself.in this process i came through open source and i felt so good while dealing with it coz its close to the reality which i never felt before during learning coding .i think its an good chance for me to dive into the open source platform and contribute here.
